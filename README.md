11 drivers crawling 3D-load.com 30K pages in 75 minutes.
Each drivers assigned 20-25 listngs' categories, stayed one browser(each driver) to shorten reopen( operatiing) time.
Program designed auto-handling errors accroding to the testing of the website and succeed finishing all assigned categories and attived data.
The whole program point is to skill testing and shorten selenium drivers processing time to get closer to requests when dealing with must driver websites.

The program is successful and selenium drivers/ undetected chormium and other heavy duty can achieve same short period like requests using multiprocessing.
